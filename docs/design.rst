Design
~~~~~~

The application consists of two components: the :module:`justicker.archivist`,
which looks after retrieving data from the API, as well as storing it in and
retrieving it from the database; and the :module:`justicker.presenter`
component, a simple webapp that serves a dashboard with stock data. Both
components are tied together by :module:`justicker`.
